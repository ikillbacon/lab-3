Grep -c counts the lines and doesnt print them
  its useful by getting the amount of lines present.

Grep -h doesnt print the filenames 
useful for making the output cleaner or for removing unwanted clutter

Grep -n prints the lines matching with the line number
  good for printing lines one to one which I assume to be neat or find errors.

Grep --null Prints a zero bit after file name
not sure what this is used for but I assume theres some use for it.

I found these inputs by using the command man grep within my terminal.
